# Exercise
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone it to your local computer
3. Recreate the folder structure as described in the [ALLFED Guidelines](https://github.com/allfed/ALLFED-Repository-Template)
4. Create a local virtual environment for the repository
5. Create two files in the src folder: numerical.py and plotting.py
6. Write a function in numerical.py that takes at least one argument and returns a numerical value
7. Write a function in plotting.py that creates a scatter plot and uses the [ALLFED Style Sheet](https://github.com/allfed/ALLFED-matplotlib-style-sheet)
8. Make your repository an installable package as described in [Good Research Code Handbook](https://goodresearch.dev/setup.html)
9. Add a Jupyter Notebook in your scripts folder and import numerical.py and call it
11. Write two tests for numerical.py
12. Make sure that the documenation of all code follows the [ALLFED Guidelines](https://github.com/allfed/ALLFED-Repository-Template#allfed-python-style-guide)
13. Automate the tests, so they run on every commit (you can just copy the files needed for that from [the template](https://github.com/allfed/ALLFED-Repository-Template)
14. Create an environment.yml that specifies how your virtual environment can be recreated and save it in the repository
15. Send back a pull request
16. Invite one of the data scientist (either florian@allfed.info or morgan@allfed.info) to review your pull request

If you get stuck at any point please reach out to one of the data scientists (either florian@allfed.info or morgan@allfed.info).
